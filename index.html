          <p>Welcome, and thank you for your interest in URSULA COMPANION CORP., doing business as Company Picnic ("Company Picnic," "we," or "us"), and our website at www.companypicnic.com, along with our related websites, hosted applications, mobile application(s), and other services provided by us (collectively, the "Service"). These Terms of Service are a legally binding contract between you and Company Picnic regarding your use of the Service.</p>

          <p><strong>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS CAREFULLY:</strong></p>

          <p>BY CLICKING "I ACCEPT," OR BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND, AS A CONDITION TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY, THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING COMPANY PICNIC'S <a href="https://privacy.companypicnic.com">PRIVACY POLICY</a> (TOGETHER, THESE "TERMS"). IF YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE, OR DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS, THEN YOU DO NOT HAVE OUR PERMISSION TO USE THE SERVICE. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, AND COMPANY PICNIC'S PROVISION OF THE SERVICE TO YOU, CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT BY COMPANY PICNIC AND BY YOU TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.</p>

          <p>YOU AGREE TO RECEIVE TEXTS FROM OR ON BEHALF OF Company Picnic AT THE PHONE NUMBER YOU PROVIDE TO US. THESE TEXTS WILL INCLUDE MARKETING MESSAGES AND OTHER OPERATIONAL MESSAGES RELATED TO Company Picnic. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THESE TEXTS MAY BE CONSIDERED TELEMARKETING UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, THEY MAY BE SENT USING AN AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE DIALING SYSTEM OR OTHER AUTOMATED TECHNOLOGY, AND YOUR CONSENT IS NOT A CONDITION OF ANY PURCHASE.</p>

          <p><strong>Arbitration NOTICE.</strong> Except for certain kinds of disputes described in Section 17 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration), you agree that disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration, and BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AND Company Picnic ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>

          <h2>1. Service Overview</h2>

          <p>Company Picnic provides software services through which users may create and interact with virtual, automated companions and create virtual content, including by using generative AI technologies.</p>

          <p><strong>Informational and Recreational Purposes Only.</strong> Company Picnic and its Service, including any information or online interaction provided by the companions, are intended for informational and/or recreational purposes only. Do not use the Service as a substitute for professional assistance or counseling from a healthcare provider or a professional therapist, counselor, or social worker, or for professional veterinary advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Nothing provided through the Service is intended to be, and must not be taken to be, the practice of medicine, psychology, psychiatry, mental health or professional therapy or counseling, veterinary medicine, or other professional healthcare service. Any reliance you place on the Service is strictly at your own risk.</p>

          <p>You acknowledge and agree that none of the information provided via the Service or your interaction with any companion has the ability to diagnose, prescribe, treat, cure, mitigate, or prevent any disease or health condition (whether relating to a person or an animal) or to perform any task that constitutes the practice of medicine or veterinary medicine, and your use of the Service does not establish a doctor-patient relationship, therapist-client relationship, or veterinarian-client-patient relationship.</p>

          <p>Certain information provided by or used by the Service may relate to or be based on information obtained from third-party sources or databases, which are subject to change. Neither Company Picnic nor the Service has independently verified or makes any representation as to the adequacy, fairness, accuracy, or completeness of any information obtained from third-party sources. Company Picnic does not recommend or endorse any specific healthcare or veterinary product, service, procedure, opinion, or other information that may be provided by the companion or via the Service based on third-party sources. Reliance on any information provided by Company Picnic or its Service is solely at your own risk.</p>

          <p>Company Picnic is not responsible for any health, safety, or social concerns, including feelings of social isolation, loneliness, or addiction to technology, associated with your use of the Service or related technologies. If you have any questions regarding your health, mental condition, or behavior, consult with a qualified professional. If you have questions regarding your companion's health, behavior, or well-being, consult with a licensed veterinarian or qualified animal behavior professional.</p>

          <p><strong>IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY, DIAL 9-1-1 OR SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP IMMEDIATELY. IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS, DIAL 9-8-8 (IN THE UNITED STATES) OR SEEK LOCAL EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE IN YOUR JURISDICTION.</strong></p>

          <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>

          <p>If you are under the age of 18 (a "Minor User"), you may not use the Service unless a parent or legal guardian (a "Guardian") first agrees to these Terms on your behalf. By using the Service and agreeing to the Terms, you represent and warrant to Company Picnic that: (a) you are at least 18 years of age or have been authorized to use the Service by your Guardian who is at least 18 years of age and entered into these Terms on your behalf; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service; and (c) your registration and your use of the Service is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations. Guardians agreeing to these Terms on behalf of a Minor User agree to supervise the Minor User's use of the Service and take full responsibility for the Minor User's compliance with these Terms. If you are an entity, organization, or company, the individual accepting these Terms on your behalf represents and warrants that they have authority to bind you to these Terms and you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

          <h2>3. Accounts and Registration</h2>

          <p>To access certain features of the Service, you may be required to register for an account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide Company Picnic with some information about yourself, such as your name, email address, telephone number, or other contact information. You agree that the information you provide to Company Picnic is accurate, complete, and not misleading, and that you will keep it accurate and up to date at all times. When you register, you may be asked to create a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you believe that your account is no longer secure, then you should immediately notify us at <a href="mailto:basket@companypicnic.com">basket@companypicnic.com</a>.</p>

          <h2>4. General Payment Terms</h2>

          <p>Certain features of the Service may require you to pay fees. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. Unless otherwise specifically provided for in these Terms, all fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable, except as required by law.</p>

          <h3>4.1. Price</h3>

          <p>Company Picnic reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. Company Picnic will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on the Service up to date. We encourage you to check our pricing page periodically for current pricing information. Company Picnic may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if Company Picnic gives you advance notice of changes before they apply. Company Picnic, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of Company Picnic's customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Terms.</p>

          <h3>4.2. Authorization</h3>

          <p>You authorize Company Picnic to charge all sums for the orders that you make and any level of Service you select as described in these Terms or published by Company Picnic, including all applicable taxes, to the payment method specified in your account. If you pay any fees with a credit card, then Company Picnic may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.</p>

          <h3>4.3. Subscription Service</h3>

          <p>The Service may include certain subscription-based plans with automatically recurring payments for periodic charges ("Subscription Service"). The "Subscription Billing Date" is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service. The Subscription Service will begin on the Subscription Billing Date and continue for the subscription period that you select on your account (such period, the "Initial Subscription Period"), and will automatically renew for successive periods of the same duration as the Initial Subscription Period (the Initial Subscription Period and each such renewal period, each a "Subscription Period") unless you cancel the Subscription Service or we terminate it. If you activate a Subscription Service, then you authorize Company Picnic or its third-party payment processors to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of the Subscription Service, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date. Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date and thereafter on the renewal date of your Subscription Service for all applicable fees and taxes for the next Subscription Period. You must cancel your Subscription Service before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. Company Picnic or its third-party payment processor will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method associated with your account or that you otherwise provide to us. You may cancel the Subscription Service through your account settings or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:basket@companypicnic.com">basket@companypicnic.com</a>. YOUR CANCELLATION MUST BE RECEIVED BEFORE THE RENEWAL DATE IN ORDER TO AVOID CHARGE FOR THE NEXT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD.</p>

          <h3>4.4. Delinquent Accounts</h3>

          <p>Company Picnic may suspend or terminate access to the Service, including fee-based portions of the Service, for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due for the Service, a delinquent account will be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any unpaid amount, including collection fees. If your payment method is no longer valid at the time a payment is due, then Company Picnic reserves the right to delete your account and any information or User Content (defined below) associated with your account without any liability to you.</p>

          <p>(a) your physical or electronic signature;<br />(b) identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;<br />(c) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and<br />(d) your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if you are residing outside of the United States, then for any judicial district in which Company Picnic may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under Section 11.2 (DMCA Notification) above or an agent of that person.</p>

          <p>A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. &sect; 512 to confirm the party's obligations to provide a valid counter notification under the Copyright Act.</p>

          <h3>11.6. Reposting of Content Subject to a Counter Notification</h3>

          <p>If you submit a Counter Notification to Company Picnic in response to a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then Company Picnic will promptly provide the person who provided the Notification of Claimed Infringement with a copy of your Counter Notification and inform that person that Company Picnic will replace the removed User Content or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days, and Company Picnic will replace the removed User Content and cease disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the Counter Notification, unless Company Picnic's Designated Agent receives notice from the party that submitted the Notification of Claimed Infringement that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on Company Picnic's system or network.</p>

          <h3>11.7. False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications</h3>

          <p>The Copyright Act provides at 17 U.S.C. &sect; 512(f) that: "[a]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. &sect; 512)] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner's authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of [Company Picnic] relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it." Company Picnic reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a Notification of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notification in violation of the law.</p>

WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE SERVICE AND YOUR DEALING WITH ANY OTHER SERVICE USER.

          <p>15.3. THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 15 (Disclaimers; No Warranties by Company Picnic) APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. Company Picnic does not disclaim any warranty or other right that Company Picnic is prohibited from disclaiming under applicable law.</p>

          <h2>16. Limitation of Liability</h2>

          <p>16.1. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE COMPANY PICNIC ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY COMPANY PICNIC ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.</p>

          <h2>17. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>

          <h3>17.1. Generally</h3>

          <p>Except as described in Section 17.2 (Exceptions) and 17.3 (Opt-Out), you and Company Picnic agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms, the Service, or communications from us will be resolved through binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is less formal than a court proceeding, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. Any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved by the arbitrator.</p>

          <p><strong>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND COMPANY PICNIC ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</strong></p>

          <h3>17.2. Exceptions</h3>

          <p>Although we are agreeing to arbitrate most disputes between us, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>

          <h3>17.3. Opt-Out</h3>

          <p>If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 17 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to URSULA COMPANION CORP (d/b/a Company Picnic), Attention: Legal Department -- Arbitration Opt-Out, 29 Little W 12th Street, New York, NY 10014, that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration ("Opt-Out Notice"). Once Company Picnic receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 17 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 18.2 (Governing Law). The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.</p>

          <h3>17.4. Arbitrator</h3>

          <p>This arbitration agreement, and any arbitration between us, is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, "AAA Rules") as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Company Picnic.</p>

          <h3>17.5. Commencing Arbitration</h3>

          <p>Before initiating arbitration, a party must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail ("Notice of Arbitration"). Company Picnic's address for Notice is: URSULA COMPANION CORP (d/b/a Company Picnic), 29 Little W 12th Street, New York, NY 10014. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) identify the name or account number of the party making the claim; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Company Picnic may commence an arbitration proceeding. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Company Picnic will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000 or if Company Picnic has received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and the other party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to AAA.</p>

          <h3>17.6. Arbitration Proceedings</h3>

          <p>Any arbitration hearing will take place in the county and state of your residence address unless we agree otherwise or, if the claim is for US$10,000 or less (and does not seek injunctive relief), you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a telephonic or video hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your residence address. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Company Picnic must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.</p>

          <h3>17.7. Arbitration Relief</h3>

          <p>Except as provided in Section 17.8 (No Class Actions), the arbitrator can award any relief that would be available if the claims had been brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Company Picnic before an arbitrator was selected, Company Picnic will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding on all parties, except (1) for judicial review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator's award includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which case that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by the arbitrator's application or conclusions of law. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p>

          <h3>17.8. No Class Actions</h3>

          <p>YOU AND Company Picnic AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Company Picnic agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>

          <h3>17.9. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision</h3>

          <p>If Company Picnic makes any substantive change to this arbitration provision, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Company Picnic's address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Company Picnic will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</p>

          <h3>17.10. Enforceability</h3>

          <p>If Section 17.8 (No Class Actions) or the entirety of this Section 17 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) is found to be unenforceable, or if Company Picnic receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 17 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 18.2 (Governing Law) will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>

          <h2>18. Miscellaneous</h2>

          <h3>18.1. General Terms</h3>

          <p>These Terms, including the <a href="https://privacy.companypicnic.com">Privacy Policy</a> and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Company Picnic regarding your use of the Service.
